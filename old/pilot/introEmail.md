Dear Colleagues,
 
Thank you for agreeing to provide feedback on the new interactive eDish graphic being created by the ASA/DIA Interactive Safety Graphics (ISG) working group! We’ve provided a quick overview of the testing process in this email and the have lots more detail in the attached “eDish Testing Guide”. We also hope that you can join us for a kickoff meeting on either 3/11/2019 or 3/13/2019 at 2:00 EST o’clock. Calendar invite and call-in information coming soon.
 
In short, we’ve split the testing into 2 separate evaluations of the tool: 

- Evaluation 1 - Evaluate the eDish Graphic and complete a web survey
- Evaluation 2 - Evaluate the safetyGraphics R Package and complete a separate web survey
 
There is a lot more detail, including a step-by-step guide for each evaluation, in the [“eDish Testing Guide”](https://safetygraphics.github.io/pilot/testerGuide), and we’re always available for questions at rinki_jajoo@merck.com.
 
Best Regards,

The ISG Working Group
