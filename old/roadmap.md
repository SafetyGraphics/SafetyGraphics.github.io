# Interactive Safety Graphics Roadmap

**Last Update: 2020-01-19**

This document summarizes the objectives and projects for the ISG group.

## Group Objectives

In general, we are currently focused on 3 interconnected areas: 

1. Improve the safetyGraphics Platform 
2. Create new charts for safety monitoring
3. Validation/Qualification

These areas of work are linked to the active projects shown below. 

## 2021 Overview

The technical team is focused on the v2 release of safetyGraphics along with the new safetyCharts and safetyData packages. Our goal is to start alpha and beta testing and have a release to CRAN by the end of Q2. The clinical team is focused on defining future graphics priorities.  The goal is to create a prioritized list of charts by the end of Q2, so that the technical team can quickly transition in to working on new charts in the 2nd half of the year. 

##  Active Projects

The ISG has several projects that are active or ready to start. 

### 1. [safetyGraphics](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics) v2.0 
- **Overview**: [safetyGraphics](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics) v2 expands the scope of the app to include all data domains and a wide range of charts. For a full list of development tasks see the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics/milestone/21)
-  **Technical Lead**: Jeremy Wildfire
-  **Clinical Lead**: None. Will gather extensive clinical feedback in beta testing.
-  **Progress**: 75%
-  **Updates**
    - 2020-10-28: Working prototype is ~80% complete. Aiming to finalize development by end of 2020, and start beta testing in early 2021
    - 2020-01-19: Formed v2 working group. Targeting Q2 release. 

### 2. [safetyCharts](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyCharts) v1.0 
- **Overview**: safetyGraphics v2 will import all charts from other libraries, including safetyCharts, which will become a dependency. Our goal is to have a robust set of R tables, listings and figures defined in this package - see this [wiki page](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyCharts/wiki/Chart-List) for a draft list of charts. The charts will include both static and interactive charts displays and will range from simple listings to more complex interactive displays. All charts in safetyCharts will be configured to easily work with our typical safetyGraphics workflow. 
-  **Technical Lead**: Jeremy Wildfire -> ???
-  **Clinical Lead**: None. Will gather extensive clinical feedback in beta testing.
-  **Progress**: 60%
-  **Updates**
    - 2020-10-28: Working prototype is ~80% complete. Aiming to finalize development by end of 2020, and start beta testing in early 2021
    - 2020-12-09: Basic package structure is in place, and we will be updating charts to follow package development best practices as we get closer to a v2 release. Starting an effort to make prioritized list of charts to create early next year, which will include components of the Novartis Participant Profile. As such we are closing out the standalone Participant Profile project and rolling it in to safetyCharts. 
    - 2020-01-19: Continuing development. Adding automation with GitHub actions. Planning to release along with safetyCharts v2.0
  
### 3. [AE Dot plot using Analysis Data](https://jwildfire.github.io/forest-plot/)
-  **Overview**: (Was: Pilot adding statistical inference in htmlwidgets) Collaborative effort between ASA (including ISG), PhUSE and FDA to create an interactive Adverse event dot plot with robust statistical methods in R Shiny.
-  **Technical Lead**: Jeremy
-  **Clinical Lead**: Melvin 
-  **Progress**: 90%
-  **Updates**
    - 2020-10-28: Jeremy created a [prototype](https://github.com/jwildfire/forest-plot) to generate a forrest plot using analysis results data and made an [htmlwidget](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyCharts/tree/forestPlot) so that it can be initialized in R.  Going to make a few more updates and call this done. Will re-evaluate approach for phase 2 of the project.  

### 4. TIRS Manuscript
- **Overview**: Invited manuscript for TIRS
-  **Technical Lead**: Jeremy
-  **Clinical Lead**: Jim
-  **Progress**: 90%
-  **Updates**
    - 2020-10-28: Jim and Mengchun created a solid first draft. Waiting on Jeremy for technical section. 
    - 2020-12-4: Jim circulated a draft to the full team in early December. Plan is to consolidate feedback and submit to TIRS in the coming weeks.
